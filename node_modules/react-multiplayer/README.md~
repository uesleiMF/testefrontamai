# react-multiplayer

Make your React apps multiplayer! This leverages [Firebase](http://firebase.com) to magically make a React component's state shared across multiple users.


## Tutorial: multiplayer notepad

Creating [multiplayer notepad](http://bash.org/?85514) is very simple. First, create a simple [controlled textarea](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html), just like you would with any form in React. We'll use [React's two-way binding helpers](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/two-way-binding-helpers.html) to save us some typing:

```javacript
/** @jsx React.DOM */

var App = React.createClass({
});

```
